# LLM Garden
This is not another LLM benchmark or leaderboard. It is meant to be a simple place to find out what models to use, how they compare with others (benchmarks), and their leaderboards, which may help practitioners decide what models to use. If you find this useful, please consider leaving a star. 

## Introduction
This repository contains useful links and information about useful models, providers, and benchmarks. I built this mostly to keep track of the models I use and the benchmarks I find useful for the respective models. It also helps to have a single page that I can refer to for all the models and leaderboards.

## Provider Benchmarks
[Inference Providers](https://leaderboard.withmartian.com/) This is primarily based on cost/performance/latency and other factors. It is a good place to start if you are looking for a provider for your model.
