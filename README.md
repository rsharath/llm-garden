# ModelHub

## Introduction
This repository contains some useful links and information around useful models, providers and their benchmarks. I built this mostly to keep track of the models I use and the benchmarks I find useful for the respective models. It also helps to have a single page that I can refer to for all the models and leaderboards.

## Provider Benchmarks
[Inference Providers](https://leaderboard.withmartian.com/) This is primarily based on cost/performance/latency and other factors. It is a good place to start if you are looking for a provider for your model.
